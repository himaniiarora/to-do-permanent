# To-Do List Web Application

## Objective
In the modern world, effective task management is crucial for productivity.  
This project aims to develop a **To-Do List Web Application** that allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks.  
Using **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** and **MongoDB**, the application provides a **dynamic and interactive** experience for seamless task management.  

Users can:
- Create new tasks
- Edit tasks (change priority)
- Delete tasks  
All data is stored permanently in a **MongoDB Atlas** database.

##  Technology Stack
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** For dynamic HTML templates with embedded JavaScript.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database to store all task-related data.
- **Node.js:** Server-side runtime for scalable and fast performance.
- **Express.js:** Web framework to handle routes, requests, and responses.

## Database Structure
The MongoDB database will include a collection named **`tasks`**.  
Each document will contain:
